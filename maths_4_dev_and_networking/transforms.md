# Signals, Systems and Transforms

**Signal** : Series of numbers/vectors or continuous function of time  

**System** : Process that converts input signals to output signals

**Transform** : Changes the Basis of a signal. In Computer Networking,
the basis of sinusoids are what we care about.

**Sinusoid** : Carrier signal associated with a time period T such that, at time t, the amplitude of the signal is defined by **cos(2.PI.t/T)**

What is interesting about Sinusoid is that it can by modelized by a vector on a disk of radius 1 that rotates at constant angular velocity w (little omega) with a period of T seconds.
