# Definitions

A proposition is a statement (communication) that is either true or false.

A predicate can be understood as a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables.

Important true propositions are called theorems.

A lemma is a preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions.

A corollary is a proposition that follows in just a few logical steps from a theorem.

Axioms are simply accepted propositions.

Logical deductions, or inference rules, are used to prove new propositions using previously proved ones. (example: _Modus Ponens_)

A proof is a sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the proposition in 
question.
