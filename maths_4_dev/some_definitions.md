# Definitions

A proposition is a statement (communication) that is either true or false.

A predicate can be understood as a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables.

Important true propositions are called theorems.

A lemma is a preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions.

A corollary is a proposition that follows in just a few logical steps from a theorem.

Axioms are simply accepted propositions.

Logical deductions, or inference rules, are used to prove new propositions using previously proved ones. (example: _Modus Ponens_)

A proof is a sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the proposition in 
question.

A number is rational when it equals a quotient of integers

A valid formula is one which is always true, no matter what truth values its variables may have.

A satisfiable formula is one which can sometimes be true—that is, there is some assignment of truth values to its variables that makes it true.
A statement P is satisfiable iff its negation NOT .P / is not valid.

A disjunctive form is simply an OR of AND -terms, where each AND -term is an AND of variables or negations of variables, for example, (A AND B) OR (A AND C)

A disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive form where each AND -term is an AND of every one of the variables or their negations in turn.

A conjunctive form is an AND of OR -terms in which the OR -terms are OR ’s only of variables or their negations.

A conjunctive normal form (CNF) is a conjunctive form where earch OR-term is an OR of every one of the variables or their negations in turn.
