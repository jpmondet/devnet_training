# Al-Khwarizmi

- Mathematical abstraction of computer program
- Computational procedure to solve a problem
- Goes with a Model of Computation 

## Model of Computation 

Specifies what operations an algorithm is allowed to use, the cost of each
operation and the cost of the algorithm.

## Time Complexity

Python Operations : https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity  (regex not
shown but re. is in general exponential time !!)
