## The Well Ordering Principle

Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element.

## Modus Ponens

This rule says that a proof of P together with a proof that
P IMPLIES Q is a proof of Q. (P, P IMPLIES Q / Q)  _(the slash "/" should be an
horizontal bar)_

## Quadratic formula 

If ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and a != 0, then x = (-b +/- SQRT(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

## Goldbach's Conjecture

If n is an even integer greater than 2, then n is a sum of two primes.

## Standard deviation

Square root of the Variance (which is the average of the squared differences
from the Mean.)

The standard deviation (sigma) of a sequence of values x1, ..., xn is zero
iff all the values are equal to the mean.

## Summation

1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2 for all nonnegative integers, n.

## Fundamental theorem of arithmetic

Every positive integer greater than one can be factored as a product of primes.

## Implication

An implication is true exactly when the if-part is false or the then-part is true.

(that is, it is only false when the if-part is true AND the then-part is false)

## If and only If (iff)

The proposition “P if and only if Q” asserts that P and Q have the same truth value. Either both are true or both are false.

## Proposition in normal form

Every propositional formula is equivalent to both a disjunctive normal form and a conjunctive normal form.
