## Modus Ponens

This rule says that a proof of P together with a proof that
P IMPLIES Q is a proof of Q. (P, P IMPLIES Q / Q)  _(the slash "/" should be an
horizontal bar)_

## Quadratic formula 

If ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and a != 0, then x = (-b +/- SQRT(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

## Goldbach's Conjecture

If n is an even integer greater than 2, then n is a sum of two primes.
